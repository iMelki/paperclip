## `POST /api/companies/:companyId/agent-hires`

Use `Idempotency-Key: hire:<plan-issue-id>:<plan-revision-id>:<slot-number>` for every plan-based hire. Keep the exact same key and request body on retries, including retries after a timeout. Two engineers in one revision use slots `1` and `2`; changed revisions use a new revision id. Do not use a run id or generate a fresh key for each retry.

The header is primary; `idempotencyKey` in the JSON body is an alternative. If both are sent, they must match. Keys are company-scoped, case-sensitive, trimmed, and contain 1 to 255 visible ASCII characters. The first successful request returns HTTP `201`. Matching retries return HTTP `200` with the same agent and approval ids and their current state, without creating another agent, approval, activity, grant, or wakeup. A different payload with the same key returns HTTP `409`; correct the request or use the key for the intended new plan revision/slot. If a hire is still in progress, retry the same key and payload. Without a key, each request creates a distinct hire.

Fingerprints use the validated request with schema defaults, recursively sorted object keys, and a sorted, deduplicated source issue set. Array order otherwise matters. Keys do not expire while the company exists. If the original hire was deleted, the key stays reserved and replay returns a conflict; do not silently hire a replacement. Idempotency never replaces permission checks or board approval. Replays apply the existing configuration-read permissions and approval-payload redaction rules.

Request body matches agent create shape (plus optional `idempotencyKey`):

```json
{
  "name": "CTO",
  "role": "cto",
  "title": "Chief Technology Officer",
  "icon": "crown",
  "reportsTo": "uuid-or-null",
  "capabilities": "Owns architecture and engineering execution",
  "desiredSkills": ["vercel-labs/agent-browser/agent-browser"],
  "adapterType": "claude_local",
  "adapterConfig": {
    "cwd": "/absolute/path",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
  },
  "instructionsBundle": {
    "entryFile": "AGENTS.md",
    "files": {
      "AGENTS.md": "You are CTO..."
    }
  },
  "runtimeConfig": {
    "heartbeat": {
      "enabled": false,
      "wakeOnDemand": true
    }
  },
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 0,
  "sourceIssueId": "uuid-or-null",
  "sourceIssueIds": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2"]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "status": "pending_approval"
  },
  "approval": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "hire_agent",
    "status": "pending",
    "payload": {
      "desiredSkills": ["vercel-labs/agent-browser/agent-browser"]
    }
  }
}
```

If company setting disables required approval, `approval` is `null` and the agent is created as `idle`.

`desiredSkills` accepts company skill ids, canonical keys, or a unique slug. The server resolves and stores canonical company skill keys.
Leave timer heartbeats disabled by default. Only set `runtimeConfig.heartbeat.enabled=true` and include an `intervalSec` when the role truly needs scheduled recurring work or the user explicitly requested it.

## Approval Lifecycle

Statuses:

- `pending`
- `revision_requested`
- `approved`
- `rejected`
- `cancelled`

For hire approvals:

- approved: linked agent transitions `pending_approval -> idle`
- rejected: linked agent is terminated

## Safety Notes

- Config read APIs redact obvious secrets.
- `pending_approval` agents cannot run heartbeats, receive assignments, or create keys.
- All actions are logged in activity for auditability.
- Use markdown in issue/approval comments and include links to approval, agent, and source issue.
- After approval resolution, requester may be woken with `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` and should reconcile linked issues.
